        <h2>About Culpeper County:</h2>
        <p>Fire and Rescue Services are provided to the residents of Culpeper County through a system comprised of both volunteer and career personnel. There are eight volunteer organizations providing services to the County. There are approximately 594 volunteer members spread among these agencies, of which approximately 361 are active operational volunteers. 
            Each of these agencies has its own officers to oversee the operations of their respective organization. The volunteers are the primary providers of fire and rescue coverage. The majority of the members work regular full‚Äêtime jobs resulting in limited availability of volunteers for weekday coverage.</p>
        <p>Culpeper County maintains mutual aid agreements with Fauquier, Madison, Orange and Rappahannock Counties. The Department of Fire, Rescue and Emergency Services also seeks to reduce demand for fire and rescue services through a proactive fire prevention and safety program. 
            The program includes numerous public education activities as well as a fire safety inspection program. Inspections are provided for the public school system as well as for commercial and industrial businesses.</p>
        <p>The Culpeper County Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association exists to assist in the coordination and provision of emergency services between Culpeper County, VA and the departments of the county. The CCVFRA provides essential services for the member companies</p>
