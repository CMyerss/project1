Reviewing Chase Myers

1.) What did you like about this website?
** I liked the fading background color from red to white. It is very simple
but adds a great look to the site. Each page is aesthically pleasing because
of the alignments.
2.) Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
a.) Which has a better user experience (and why)?
** I would have to say it just depends are on the type of user; I had more pictures
and tried to please through images while Chase has more informational stuff.
We both have ways to interact with the user and ask for input which is good.
b.) Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
** I believe Chase structured his code better; it looks neat and makes sense the way
he structured it. I had a seperate folder for pictures and then a single css sheet, while
Chase has a folder for each.
3.) Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
a.) if not, suggest some specific improvements
** Only thing I would say is maybe don't have too long of code lines; we were always taught not
to have a line stretching across the screen; its not good checkstyle.
4.) Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
a.) were semantically appropriate elements selected
b.) is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
5.) Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
** I would say may be add more images to appeal to the user; for the page about your locations, you can add
pictures of each station.
