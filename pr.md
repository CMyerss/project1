What did you like about this website?
    It’s incredibly easy to read - while some pages are light on general content, it’s obvious that this structure and methodology would work very well if upscaled to fit more content.
Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's.
    One significant difference is the behavior when resizing. While my site resizes and adjusts the layout of the navbar and content, the author’s site is intuitively designed in such a way that content expands to fill free space
Which has a better user experience (and why)?
    I believe this site has a better user experience, as my site’s content reorganization and resizing isn’t always perfect, leaving some content cut off when the page is resized.
Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
    I believe this codebase would be more maintainable, as the styling for it relies on a single css file for all pages.
Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories? If not, suggest some specific improvements
    Code is well structured within files, with clean spacing and element organization that is easy to match with how the content appears on the site. Organization between files and directories is good, with external stylesheets, separate directories for stylesheets and images, and well named files that correctly match the content they provide.
Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
were semantically appropriate elements selected
    Included header, footer, and used nav for the navbar.
is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
    Yes, all code in styles.css serves a purpose with little to no duplication.
Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    This project was really good, my only comment would be that adding more content to some of the pages could really help show off the reusability of the method you’ve been using.
