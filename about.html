        <h2>The Brandy Station Volunteer Fire Department</h2>
        <p>The organizational meeting of this fire company was held in the office of Charles P. Humphries, Manager of the Bottled Gas Corporation of Virginia. The first meeting as a fire company was held in the Brandy Station High School, 
            at which time the Charter was requested from the State of Virginia. Each of the Charter Members donated $100 to handle initial expenses and to get the fire company started. The original fire hall was built in 1952 with no assistance from the state or the county. 
            All funds used for this project were raised by the department and auxiliary members. Work was performed and the hall erected by members in their spare time and through the night.</p>
        <p>The first fire engine was purchased with funds raised by the hard work and dedication of the department and auxiliary members. Subsequent funds were raised for the organization by the members of both the department and auxiliary through bingo, carnivals and dinners.</p>
        <p>The hall was formally dedicated in 1952 where Admiral Lewis L. Strauss served as the master of ceremonies. The corner stone was laid by the Stevens Lodge #169 A.F. & A.M.</p>
